# DemoApp
Create an application that searches for the top images of the week from the Imgur gallery and displays them in a list.
The app needs to provide the user with the ability to input text as part of
the search query before displaying relevant results.
Each cell needs to display the following for each search result:
• title
• date of the post in local time (DD/MM/YY hh:mm am/pm)
• number of additional images in the post (if there are multiple)
• image
A search result should display the first image from its list if it contains
multiple images.
There needs to be a toggle feature to change the display results:

• If the toggle is ‘List’, the app should show a list containing full-
screen width horizontal cells, with a small thumbnail along with all

the other information arranged neatly within the cell. Up to you how
you want to arrange the layout of all information listed above is
displayed.
• If the toggle is ‘Grid’, the app should display larger thumbnails in
a grid-like view. The design is up to you if it looks elegant. Other
information should still be displayed alongside each thumbnail.
